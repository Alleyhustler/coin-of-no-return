<h2>Nanisa's Recipes for Christmas and Easter</h2>
<div class='ln02'>
<p>My Lithuanian-American grandmother (called Nanisa by the Indian side of our family) gave me these recipes this past Christmas. I'm afraid they're not to my taste (all her baking is very sweet!), so I'm passing them on in hopes that they'll find someone who can better appreciate them!<br>
Nanisa has been making the tassies and carrot cake and sending them to my family for as long as I can remember. Even though they're too sweet for me, they're still nostalgic, and pleasantly sweet in a different way :)<br>
If you make them, send in an email with a comment and/or photo for me to display at the end of the page, if you'd like! Also, feel free to share or arrange this recipe all you want. I'd appreciate a link back (and preferably a heads-up via email/comment) if you repost in full, but I'm not strict about it. Have fun!
</div>
<div class='ln02'>
<p>Below is a mostly unedited copy of the document she gave me. It may be disorganized but I don't know enough about recipes (or her intentions) to revise it lol.

<ol>
  <li><mark>Dough</mark> - With <em>only the oven light on</em>, place a mixing bowl containing the measured cold butter & cream cheese into the oven to soften to room temperature. Thoroughly combine w/a hand-held electric mixer. Add flour, mixing w/<em>wooden spoon</em> until thoroughly blended in. (Don't overmix.) Press the dough w/your hands into a solid mass. Chill in refrigerator for about an hr before dividing the dough into <em>0.56 oz portions</em>. Form each portion into a ball, collecting them in a container. Refrigerate until ready to press them into the tassie pans.
  <li><mark>Filling</mark> - Whisk eggs w/electric hand mixer, adding the remaining filling ingredients (<em>except for the chopped pecans</em>). Refrigerate till ready to use.
  <li><em>Lightly</em> grease the tassie cups w/Crisco. Press each dough ball into a tassie cup. When the pan is completely filled w/dough shells, measure <em>1/8 tsp chopped pecans</em> into the bottom of each dough cup & place it in the fridge or freezer (for approx 10 min) or until ready to add filling. Take a pan of formed dough from the fridge to add the syrup filling.
  <li><em>Preheat oven <b><u>350F for dark pans (375F for light pans)</u></b> w/oven rack in middle position. <b><u>DON'T DOUBLE-PAN.</u></b></em>
  <li>When ready to <b><u>dispense the prepared syrup</u></b>, whisk it - to mix together the separated ingredients. Ladle some of the syrup into a <b><i>1-piece Kitchen Batter Dispenser</i></b> filling each cup <b><u>scantily 3/4 full.</u></b>
  <em><b>(<u>Scantily</u> - in order to prevent syrup from expanding over the top of dough while baking, making it difficult to remove the tassies after baking)</b>. Distribute syrup quickly to the tassie cups (in order to prevent the ingredients from separating). Top each filled tassie w/add'l rounded <b>1/4 tsp</b> chopped pecans.</em> Put back in the refrigerator to firm up the syrup until ready to bake.
  <li><b>Bake for <em>20 min</em> until filling is puffy & pastry is lightly browned.</b> As soon as they're out of oven, <em><b><u>IMMEDIATELY, use the tip of a toothpick or thin skewer tip</u></b></em> to loosen each tassie (circling the tassie around the cup, loosening overflowed syrup before it has a chance to "set" hard, gluing the tassie shell to the pan). If a tassie had syrup overflow & anchored the tassie to the muffin cup, quickly loosen & remove the overflow, then lift & tilt the tassie <u><i>slightly</i></u> to the side (while it's still in the tassie cup). When slightly cool, use the toothpick tip to remove the tassies, place them on a paper toweled cooling rack, so some of the greasiness is removed before storing. When gifting, pack in grease-proof containers or line w/grease-proof tissue or plastic wrap to prevent grease-spots on paper gift boxes.
  <li>The tassies can be stored in an airtight container at rm temp or frozen for later use.

  <br>
  <b>Quarter Recipe - <mark>2 1/4 Dozen</mark></b><br>
  1 1/2 c a/p flour (7.5 oz) & 1/2 tsp baking powder<br>
  1 <b><u>extra-large</u></b> egg (approx <b><u>1 oz</u></b>)<br>
  1/4 lb (4 oz) butter, 1/8 c sugar, 1/32 tsp salt<br>

  1/4 tsp vanilla
  </div>
</div><hr>
<ol>
  <li><i><b><u>For best results, it is important to weigh the ingredients where weighing is indicated.</u></b></i>
  <li><i>Weigh & sift together the total measure of flour & baking powder for the recipe. Set aside.</i>
  <li><i>In small bowl, whisk eggs. Set aside. (Ex-lrg egg is approx 2 oz, but it's ok if + or − a fraction.)</i>
  <li><i>With elec mixer, cream butter, sugar, & salt until light & fluffy.</i>
  <li><i>Add & mix in the cream cheese.</i>
  <li><i>Add & mix in the whisked eggs.</i>
  <li><i>Add & mix in part of flour mixture that was set aside. (<b><u>1 c for Whole Recipe</u></b> or <b><u>1/2 c for Half Recipe</u></b> or <b><u>1/4 c for Quarter Recipe</u></b>.)</i>
  <li><i>Again, add & mix in part of flour mixture that was set aside. (<b><u>1 c for Whole Recipe</u></b> or <b><u>1/2 c for Half Recipe</u></b> or <b><u>1/4 c for Quarter Recipe</u></b>.)</i>
  <li><i>Add & mix in the vanilla.</i>
  <li>Finally, add remaining flour mixture <i>(<b><u>1 c for Whole Recipe</u></b> or <b><u>1/2 c for Half Recipe</u></b> or <b><u>1/4 c for Quarter Recipe</u></b>)</i>. Work in w/wooden spoon until dough doesn't seem too sticky & comes away from spoon.
  <li>Knead slightly w/your hand in the bowl until it comes together & is smoothly textured. <i><b><u>DON'T OVERWORK OR ADD ANY MORE OR LESS FLOUR THAN SPECIFIED IN THE RECIPE.</u></b></i>
  <li>Put dough on plate, cover & put in fridge several hours or overnight. Weigh & form balls of chilled dough (<b><u>0.68 oz each</u></b>), place balls in a container, & refrigerate an hour or longer.
  <li>When ready to assemble, work w/batches of 10, 10, & 10 equaling 30 per cookie sheet.
  <li><b><u>Lightly</u></b> dust working surface w/sifted powdered sugar (a shaker cup works well). Roll out a ball <u>once</u> to 1/8" thickness. Flip over, give it a quarter turn & roll it again, creating a circular piece. Place about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp filling on each circle. Fold dough over the filling to enclose it, making a seal about 1/4" short of the opposite side. Fold in the <b>side</b> ends & continue to roll & mold the pastry like a little jelly roll. Set them in a flat container or plate & keep them in fridge until you complete the remaining two batches, chilling them all in fridge for a few min before panning them (w/sealed edge on bottom).
  <li>When ready to bake, preheat oven to 375F w/an <b><u>empty</u></b> cookie sheet on middle rack of oven. Place refrigerated kolachki <b><u>(spaced 5 rows of 6 = 30)</u></b> on another <b><u>parchment-paper-lined</u></b> cookie sheet of equal size as the one in the oven. (Frozen kolachki should be allowed to thaw a little before baking.) Carefully fit the cookie sheet of kolachki into the heated cookie sheet that's already in the oven <i>(double-panning prevents over-browning the bottom of kolachki or other cookies being baked)</i>.
  <li>Bake until golden (25-<b><u>30</u></b> min). Remove the pans from oven, & carefully take the top pan of kolachki off the bottom pan and allow the kolachki to cool on the cookie sheet. Put the bottom pan back into the hot oven if more kolachki are to be baked.

<section id='cornsyrup'>
<h3>Substitutes for Light Corn Syrup</h3>
<ul>
  <li><mark>Sugar and Water:</mark> For each cup of light corn syrup, substitute 1 c granulated sugar dissolved in 1/4 c warm water. Need dark corn syrup? Substitute 1 c packed brown sugar for the granulated sugar & dissolve it in 1/4 c water. This syrup makes a great stand-in for baked goods (like pecan pie), but because sugar crystallizes at high temp, it won't work for candy recipes that need to go past the soft-ball stage (235F).
  <li><mark>Honey:</mark> Corn syrup and honey are equal replacements meaning you can substitute 1 cup honey for1 cup corn syrup). But similar to sugar, honey won't prevent crystallization, so it's not the best choice for making caramel or candy, but it can work well in other recipes as long as you don't mind its distinct flavor. Tip: As a general rule, the lighter the honey, the milder the flavor.
  <li><mark>Agave Nectar:</mark> A one-to-one substitution, agave syrup (aka agave nectar) has a mild flavor that works great in most recipes that call for corn syrup. (But again, not candy.)
  <li><mark>Brown Rice Syrup:</mark> For a substitute that'll work in candy recipes that need to go to the hard-ball stage, opt for brown rice syrup. This sticky mixture has the same chemical properties of corn syrup & will prevent crystallization. It does have a slightly nutty flavor which might not work for all recipes.
  <li><mark>Golden Syrup:</mark> A pantry staple in the U.K., this buttery syrup can be substituted one-to-one for corn syrup and can also be used in candy making.
  <li><mark>Cane Syrup:</mark> This tastes similar to molasses & can replace corn syrup in equal measurements. But again, this substitute won't work in candy recipes since it won't prevent crystallization.
  <li><mark>Maple Svrup:</mark> Our favorite pancake topper can be used as a one-to-one substitute for corn syrup in most recipes (but not candy making). Keep in mind that maple syrup has quite a strong, earthy flavor.
