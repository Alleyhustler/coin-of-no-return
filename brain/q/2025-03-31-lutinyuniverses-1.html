<h2>KEWL SURVEYS (#1)</h2>
<p><em>What's your name?</em> Choccy
<p><em>What are you wearing at the moment?</em> Purple long-sleeved shirt, dark green cargo pants, my usual thin blue glasses, and tiny star-shaped earrings.
<p><em>Anything exciting happened today?</em> Today was as uneventful as it could get. But yesterday the power line right in front of my house exploded, if that counts. It was bright green and scared the shit out of me since I was sitting right by the window.
<p><em>What's the first thing you remember?</em> The guy who came in to fix our TV was the biggest man 2-year-old me had seen so his massive back has been seared into my brain.
<p><em>Most embarrassing moment?</em> Can’t think of one at the moment (thankfully).
<p><em>Shy or outgoing?</em> Pretty shy.
<p><em>Ever slept outside?</em> Went camping once for a friend’s birthday. I think that was the only time.
<p><em>Ever been in love?</em> Currently madly in love with my partner. Hi if you’re reading this I love you
<p><em>If yes - ever done anything about it?</em> Yes (obviously) but funnily enough I originally planned to take it to my grave.
<p><em>A favorite lyric at the moment?</em> 128号の謎 by Serani Poji (not bothering to translate rn lmao):
                                        <p>そういえば33号と86号がいない<br>
                                           どっかで死んでるのかもね<br>
                                           でもいいの<br>
                                           スペアはたくさんあるし<br>
                                        <p>あたしよあたしよ…みてみて…<br>
                                           あたしなの<br>
                                           全部みんなあたしどれもあたし<br>
                                           ベルトコンベアーにのって<br>
                                           生産生産…1、2、3、4
<p><em>Favorite fruit?</em> <s>myself</s> Peaches
<p><em>A huge crowd or a small bunch of friends?</em> Small bunch!
<p><em>Ever broke someone's trust?</em> My parents… whoops… (lied about doing my assignments &lt;3)
<p><em>Ever had your trust broken?</em> Quite a few times by elementary school friends. Hasn't happened in/after high school, though.
<p><em>What's worse - dumping or being dumped?</em> Never really experienced either, so I’m not sure.
<p><em>Are there things you don't tell your parents?</em> My IRL preferred name lol. They’re not as accepting as they seem and I don’t trust them not to make fun of me or something. I’m out to basically everyone else.
<p><em>Closest thing to a role model?</em> Maybe my cool high school AP English teacher.
<p><em>Do you have a friend that you stay close to no matter time and distance?</em> Yep! 3 of them!
<p><em>How are you right now?</em> Shrug. I’ve been better. I have a headache so once I’m done with this I’m heading to bed.
