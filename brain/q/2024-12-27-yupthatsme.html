<h2>QUESTIONS!</h2>
<p><em>Filled out:</em> 2024/12/27
<p><em>What were you doing at 11 last night:</em> Teaching my partner about the histories of different LGBT flags. and talking about Gabriel ULTRAKILL
<p><em>Do you think you and your best friend will be friends in 10 years:</em> Definitely!
<p><em>What could you eat any day of the week and never get tired of:</em> Rice… but that's cheating because I basically already do. 2nd place is probably karaage.
<p><em>Funniest thing that happened in the last 24 hours:</em> Watched the M-1 Grand Prix. Congrats Reiwa Roman! This year was particularly good; every pair was so funny.
<p><em>Do you have any plans for the weekend:</em> Nope, other than potentially going to Costco with my mom. and webmastery. and ULTRAKILL 
<p><em>Let me guess, your last incoming call was from the opposite sex:</em> They're genderfluid so…half right?? I guess??
<p><em>Would you kiss anyone you have texts from in your phone:</em> Take a fucking guess (yes. yes i would kiss my partner. whom i text every day)
<p><em>Do you find drinking unattractive:</em> No, as long as it's responsibly.
<p><em>When was the last time something bothered you:</em> Probably yesterday. *cough* mother
<p><em>Do you know how to work a computer well:</em> Hell yeah
<p><em>To who did you last give the finger to:</em> My best friends lol. I don't give the finger to people I actually hate.
<p><em>Six months ago, can you remember who you liked, who was it:</em> No one, I think. I realized my crush on my now-partner in late July. Before then, I sort of avoided thinking about romance since I knew my options are limited (being T4T and autistic and licenseless is hard).
<p><em>Anything embarrassing happen today:</em> Nope lol
<p><em>Has anyone ever done mean things to you while you were sleeping:</em> Sort of? I got like 5 photos taken by my friend when I was taking a nap at college. All of them had different weird Instagram filters (like a dog peeing on me etc) and were sent to the groupchat lol.
<p><em>Do you have someone of the opposite sex you can tell everything to:</em> Ok, ok, I get it, this survey is old. 
<p><em>Would you rather be at the beach or lake:</em> Neither. Forest creek
<p><em>Last thing you spent money on:</em> Star-shaped titanium threadless labrets! I love getting titanium labrets for my lobe piercings since I can just leave them in and forget about it and still look awesome.
<p><em>What are you doing after this:</em> Going to bed!
<p><em>Your song of the week:</em> Requiem - Heaven Pierce Her, Nyan - MARETU
<p><em>Have you ever cried from being so mad:</em> Of course. Who hasn't at some point in their life
<p><em>Are you happy with the choices you've made:</em> Maybe not 100% happy, but I'm content. They all make up who I currently am whether I like it or not, and I thankfully (and surprisingly) like my current self.
<p><em>I bet you miss someone, huh:</em> my beloved long-distance partnerrrr :'( (I just talked with them an hour ago lol)
<p><em>Would you rather be forced to eat 100 bananas or 100 apples:</em> 100 apples. Bananas are more hit-or-miss, especially since I don't like them when they're squishy or too sweet.
<p><em>Have you dated the person you texted last:</em> Yeah. Right now. I'm dating them right n
<p><em>Is good grammar attractive:</em> I…guess? I am the kind of person to correct a person's grammar, but making grammar mistakes is not unattractive and having “flawless” grammar doesn't make a person hot. Especially when your partner is an English learner.
<p><em>Are you friends with the people you were friends with two years ago:</em> Of course! Who the hell loses contact with their friends in just two years?
<p><em>Who was the last person to call you baby:</em> Idk
<p><em>What is your favorite color:</em> Red
<p><em>What color are your eyes:</em> Dark brown
<p><em>How tall are you:</em> 150cm/5ft
<p><em>If you could have one wish right now what would it be:</em> Free Palestine
<p><em>Do you want to get married and have children one day:</em> Married, sure, if possible, but not necessarily. Children, nope.
<p><em>Who is the 9th contact in your phone:</em> A classmate from 6th grade (we had a groupchat way back when).
<p><em>Ever liked someone who treated you like crap:</em> Nope!
<p><em>If you could spend more time with someone you used to be very close with, would you:</em> Yeah, my maternal grandparents.
<p><em>What are you listening to now:</em> Nothing
<p><em>What woke you up today:</em> My alarm (僕の恋愛事情と台所事情 - TOKIO) and my partner (we sometimes keep the call going overnight)
<p><em>Would you take someone back if they cheated on you:</em> Probably not?
<p><em>Where was your default picture taken:</em> I never use my picture as icons or profile pics (even for irl stuff like contacts photos).
<p><em>How many windows are open on your computer:</em> Like 30 probably
<p><em>Anything you really want:</em> A new iPad would be nice since my current one (iPad Air 3) is halfway out the door.
<p><em>How many pillows do you sleep with:</em> 1 pillow + 1 pillow-shaped/sized Kerokerokeroppi + 1 BLÅHAJ
<p><em>Can you have more than one best friend:</em> Yeah!!!!!! I do!!!!!!!
<p><em>What was last thing you drank:</em> Water. Hot cocoa if that doesn't count.
<p><em>How many pets do you have:</em> 3 cats!
<p><em>What do you like better: apple cider or hot chocolate:</em> Take a guess (hint: 2 questions ago)
<p><em>Who last texted you:</em> My partner. we have already established this.
<p><em>What do you want right now:</em> To play Inscryption tbh
